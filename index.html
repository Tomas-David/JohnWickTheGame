                  <h2>About Idea</h2>
                  <p>The original idea was to make a game based on the scene in episode 4 where he trys to get to the cathedral for the final duel. But the timing didn't work out. So I took the scene from the first episode where he goes to get his car. For the first time I tried to go through a project in unity from start to finish. This attempt didn't go so well, the result is quite buggy but I did the best I could.</p>
